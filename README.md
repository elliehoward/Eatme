# Eatme
 EatMe is a meal planner application. It has pre-loaded meals
 and a form so that you can add custom meals to the database. In plan view you can click and drag the meals to the meal plan. After you complete your plan you can save it and go on to print a shopping list with all the ingredients you will need to follow through on your newly created meal plan.
